This is Practical Machine Learning class repo

This repo contains the report on prediction of barbell lifting activity using the provided dataset in the course.  

Note: my gh-pages does not work, however, I have created .md files that allows you to view the html pages without having to download the .htlm files to your computer.

Just click on pml_writeup.md to see the same content as .html but without the html gibberish.
